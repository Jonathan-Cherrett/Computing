        <h1>Quantum computers</h1>

        <p>Quantum computers could be used to solve many of today's pressing problems. They have the unique ability to store
            data as a probability function rather than as simple 1s or 0s. These data are known as "qubits", which is short
            for "quantum bits".</p>
        <p>Today, the very best quantum computers are far from outcompeting simulations on traditional machines. But the power
            of a quantum computer is exponentially dependent on the number of qubits it uses, and therefore they are always
            getting more and more powerful. Soon there will be a point where the power of quantum computers surpasses that
            of traditional machines.</p>
        <p>There are also some dangers involved with quantum computers. Most of today's encryption relies on methods which could
            be easily broken by such a machine without specially developed quantum encryption.</p>
