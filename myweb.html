        <h3>The living area of rabbit</h3>
        <p>A rabbit environment is where it lives - not just where it <em>sleeps, eats, exercises and goes to the toilet</em>, but any place that it has access to. The environment also includes all the objects a rabbit comes into contact with and the materials, such as <strong>bedding</strong>, that it needs to stay healthy and happy.</p>
